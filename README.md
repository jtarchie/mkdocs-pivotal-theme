# Usage

In your `requirements.txt` file, add the line `git+https://github.com/jtarchie/mkdocs-pivotal-theme#egg=mkdocs-pivotal`

Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

In your `mkdocs.yml` file, change the `theme` key to be `theme: pivotal`. You may have to install material theme as well, which can be done by `pip install mkdocs-material`.

Use `mkdocs serve` to preview changes.

You'll now have the docs theme.
